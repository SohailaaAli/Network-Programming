IT342: Network Programming 
Project (10 points)
Best Wishes Dr. Ali Hussein Ahmed
Develop a client-server application with the following functionalities:
1. Implement a single-threaded server to handle incoming client requests 
sequentially, ensuring simplicity and straightforward operation.
2. Enable bidirectional communication between the client and server, allowing 
users to exchange messages in real-time.
3. Allow clients to request the contents of a specific directory from the server, 
facilitating efficient retrieval of directory information.
4. Enable the server to respond to client requests by sending a comprehensive 
list of files and folders contained within the specified directory, ensuring 
clarity and completeness of the directory structure.
5. Provide clients with the capability to request specific files from the server, 
enhancing flexibility and targeted file retrieval.
6. Implement robust file transfer functionality on the server side to promptly 
fulfill client requests by transmitting the requested files securely and 
efficiently to the client.
7. Bring the project to the practical lab sessions to demonstrate its functionality 
and receive hands-on guidance and support from the instructor.
8. Evaluation of this project will be based on a scale of 10, with points allocated 
for various aspects such as functionality, code quality, and adherence to 
project requirements.
9. During the exam, you will be required to add two additional features to the 
project. These features will be worth an additional 10 points, providing an 
opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of network programming 
concepts and extend the functionality of the application beyond the initial 
requirements.
10."Incorporate video streaming functionality into your project, and you will 
receive an additional 2 points bonus."
